## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Control Science and Engineering at **Zhejiang University (ZJU)**, where I have been since 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Liu](https://april.zju.edu.cn/team/dr-yong-liu/) at the [April Lab](https://april.zju.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests

- **3D Computer Vision**: 3D Perception and Understanding (*e.g.*, 3D object detection, 3D panoptic segmentation); Point Cloud Processing (*e.g.*, moving object segmentation, terrain estimation).
- **Autonomous Driving:** World models, generative models, end-to-end autonomous driving.
